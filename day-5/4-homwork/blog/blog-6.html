      <p>
        Dreams and goals help me move forward. They give motivation and help me <br>
        find the strength to fight. Sometimes it is very hard to move toward <br>
        what you want. You may have to walk along a very thin line, sometimes <br>
        falling off and needing to climb the mountain again. You can return to <br>
        the beginning many times, but in reality you never truly return to the <br>
        start. After each fall, it takes less time to rise and move on. This <br>
        means there is progress, and if there is progress, you are already far <br>
        from the starting point.

        <h2>Never Give Up</h2>
        <p>
          The main thing is not to give up — to strive and work hard. I believe <br>
          that any effort is always appreciated. Any hard work will definitely <br>
          bear fruit. It will not go unnoticed. The main thing is never to tell <br>
          yourself “I can’t”. If you have a goal, you can do anything, as long <br>
          as you give your maximum and support yourself.

          Every step, even the smallest, brings you closer to your dreams and <br>
          goals.
