          Exploring psychology and the power of body language.

      <p>
        I've always been fascinated by psychology — how people think, feel, and <br>
        communicate beyond words. Body language, in particular, is incredibly <br>
        interesting to me: a look, a gesture, or posture can say more than many <br>
        sentences. Studying these nonverbal signals helps me understand others <br>
        and myself better.

        <h2>What draws me to psychology</h2>
        <p>
          Growing up, I noticed how small signs and reactions reveal true <br>
          emotions. Psychology books taught me frameworks to interpret <br>
          behaviour, while real-life observations made the lessons meaningful. <br>
          Reading about motivation, habits, and communication gave me tools to <br>
          improve my relationships and study habits.

        <h2>Body language: small signals, big meaning</h2>
        <p>
          Body language is a silent language we all use. Eye contact, hand <br>
          movements, and posture can show confidence, nervousness, interest, or <br>
          boredom. Learning to read these cues helps in conversations, <br>
          interviews, and teamwork. I enjoy practicing this awareness and <br>
          applying it in everyday life.

          Short reflection: Psychology helps me be more empathetic and curious <br>
          about people — and that's a big part of who I am.
