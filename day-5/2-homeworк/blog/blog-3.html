      <p>
        Programming has become my main focus for development. I enjoy creating <br>
        websites and applications, seeing how ideas come to life in code. It's <br>
        similar to art â€” except instead of paint, we use lines of code.

        <h2>Why It Interests Me</h2>
        <p>
          Every task is a puzzle. You must not only find a solution but make it <br>
          clean and efficient. This combination of logic and creativity inspires <br>
          me the most.

        <h2>Creativity in Development</h2>
        <p>
          I often think of code as a craft. It requires patience and precision <br>
          but also gives freedom to imagine. I enjoy combining knowledge to <br>
          create something new.
