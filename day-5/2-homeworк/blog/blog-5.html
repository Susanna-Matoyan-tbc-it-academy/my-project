      <p>
        Even though I haven't traveled much yet, I have clear goals about the <br>
        places I want to visit in the future. Planning a journey teaches <br>
        patience, organization, and broadens imagination. Thinking about new <br>
        countries, cultures, and experiences motivates me to grow and learn.

        <h2>Why Travel Goals Matter</h2>
        <p>
          Setting travel goals gives direction and purpose. It helps me focus on <br>
          planning, saving, and learning about different cultures in advance. <br>
          Even imagining these experiences brings joy and inspiration.

        <p>
          Travel teaches adaptability, curiosity, and appreciation of diversity. <br>
          Visualizing new experiences allows me to practice problem-solving and <br>
          planning skills. It also inspires me to be open-minded and embrace <br>
          opportunities in life.
