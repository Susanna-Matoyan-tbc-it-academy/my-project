    Welcome to TBC IT Academy! Student: Susanna Matoyani

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Susanna Matoyan, I am 21 years old. I love writing code
      because, for me, it’s not just a skill or a job—it’s a way to fully
      express myself. Even when creating a single piece of logic, there are
      countless paths to take, and I have the freedom to choose my own unique,
      individual path to solve each problem. I pour not only my knowledge and
      skills into it but also my inner soul, imagination, and
      creativity—everything that makes the process alive and one-of-a-kind. For
      me, coding is like painting is for an artist: if they use colors, I use
      logic, algorithms, and functions. Every line of code is an opportunity to
      create something unique, to experiment, and to give free rein to my
      thoughts. This process is so absorbing that I can completely immerse
      myself in it, forgetting about time, meals, and everything else, fully
      losing myself in a world of ideas and possibilities. Code is my space for
      freedom, creativity, and self-expression, where every problem becomes a
      chance to showcase my individuality and put the fullest part of myself
      into the solution.
